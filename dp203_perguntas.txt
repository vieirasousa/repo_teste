You need to implement encryption at rest by using transparent data encryption (TDE).
You implement a master key.
What should you do next?

Create a certificate that is protected by the master key.

You need to add permissions to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account that allows assigning POSIX access controls.
Which role should you use?

Storage Blob Data Owner

------

You have an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
You grant developers Read and Write permissions by using ACLs to the files in the path \root\input\cleaned.
The developers report that they cannot open the files.
How should you modify the permissions to ensure that the developers can open the files?

Add Contributor permission to the developers.

-------------------------

You use Azure Data Factory to connect to a notebook that runs in an Azure Databricks cluster. The connection is set to use access tokens.
You need to revoke a userâ€™s token.
What should you use?

Token Management API 2.0

-------------------------------

You need to grant an Azure Active Directory user access to write data to an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account.
Which security technology should you use to grant the access?


RBAC

----------------------------------


You have an Azure Storage account named account1.
You need to ensure that requests to account1 can only be made from specific domains.
What should you configure?

> CORS

----------------------------------

You have a pipeline in an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace. The pipeline runs a stored procedure against the dedicated SQL pool.
The pipeline throws errors occasionally.
You need to check the error information by using the minimum amount of administrative effort.
What should you do?


> From the Monitor page of Azure Synapse Studio, review the Pipeline runs tab.

---------------------------------------

You have an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace.
You need to monitor wait stats that relate to the SQL Server OS state on each node of the dedicated SQL pools.
Which view should you use?

> sys.dm_pdw_wait_stats

-----------------------------------------

You have an Azure Data Factory named ADF1.
You need to ensure that you can analyze pipeline runtimes for ADF1 for the last 90 days.
What should you use?

> Azure Monitor

Data Factory only stores pipeline runtimes for 45 days. To view the data for a longer period, that data must be sent to Azure Monitor, where the information can then be retrieved and viewed.

------------------------------------------

You monitor an Apache Spark job that has been slower than usual during the last two days. The job runs a single SQL statement in which two tables are joined.
You discover that one of the tables has significant data skew.
You need to improve job performance.
Which hint should you use in the query

>SKEW

You should use the SKEW hint in the query.

The COALESCE hint reduces the number of partitions to the specified number of partitions.

The REPARTITION hint is used to specify the number of partitions using the specified partitioning expressions.

The REBALANCE hint can be used to rebalance the query result output partitions, so that every partition is a reasonable size (not too small and not too big).

---------------------------------------------

You have an Azure Databricks cluster that uses Databricks Runtime 10.1.
You need to automatically compact small files for creating new tables, so that the target file size is appropriate to the use case.
What should you set?

>delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact = auto

You should use delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact = auto because it compacts the files to the size that is appropriate to the use case.

delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact = true and delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact = legacy compact the files to 128 MB.

delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact = false disables automated file compaction.
